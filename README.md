## ðŸŽ¯ Acceptance Criteria

To be added to the list, communities must meet the following requirements:

1. **Open Source Focus:** Your community should be tied directly to an open source project and not Discord-focused (e.g., Discord bots or modifications are not accepted).
2. **Community Size:** Your community must have at least **1,000 members**, or the associated GitHub repository must have **1,000 stars** or more.
3. **Guidelines Compliance:** Your community must adhere to the [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).

> **Note:** If you own a large bot, consider [verifying it](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040720412) as an alternative.
